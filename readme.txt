### Our story: How we created WP Layouts

WP Layouts happened entirely by accident.

You see, we built WP Layouts to solve our own pain points.

We were tired of the time it took importing, exporting and storing layouts the **old way** and frankly, we’d rather spend our time doing other things like building new layouts.

We knew there had to be a better, more efficient workflow so we created it!

Since then, WP Layouts has revolutionized the process for our team so much that there’s **no way** we’ll ever go back. And we’re positive that once you try it, you’ll never want to go back either.

**So what were our pain points?**

#### The Old Way Was Too Slow

One of the main advantages to building with layouts is that it’s so much faster than starting from scratch. But it was never quite as fast as we wanted it to be.

#### Our Layouts Didn’t Follow Us From Site to Site

Even the super-useful Divi Library has limitations. The Divi Library makes life a lot easier for website creators because it allows you to save layouts you’ve already created — or layouts you’ve bought — for easy access when you’re building the other pages on your site. This way, you only have to upload it once, and it’s available every time you want to use it to create another page or another module on the same website.

The problem is your layouts don’t follow you from site to site. So if you’ve got a personal collection of layouts that you use over and over to build websites, you need to upload them to each website individually.

#### Digging Through External Stored Files

Having to upload to each website each time meant going through multiple steps, including finding the right layout either on your hard drive or in a folder somewhere in the cloud, like in Dropbox or Google Drive. Depending on how many layouts you have — and if you make websites for a living, you probably have a **lot** of them, like we do — this in itself can be a **source of frustration**.

#### The Import/Export Process Was Crashing Our Server

The breaking point came when the process of importing layouts started crashing our, and our clients websites. For a while, every time we imported a layout, the site went down. To say this was extremely frustrating is an understatement.

But there was a silver lining to our pain.

Out of necessity, we took a look at the existing process of importing and exporting layouts, and found much to be desired. So our developers got to work building a better import/export protocol — again, for our own use, just so **our site would stop crashing**.

But our developers, being the clever bunch they are, realized there was so much more we could do with the import/export process beyond just making it more stable.

If we were going to invest time and energy into changing the way the process worked, **we might as well go all the way** and create a system that would really make our work easier and our lives better.

So we thought:

* Why not have our own cloud storage specifically designed for storing and organizing layouts?
* And why not make it easy to organize, and even easier to search by including thumbnail images?
* And why not integrate it directly into the WordPress Dashboard and the most popular WordPress builders (i.e., Gutenberg, Divi, Elementor, and Beaver Builder)?
* And why not make it super simple and easy to save your current page layout, a section of the page — or even child theme – directly to your library, complete with all content, css and php files?
* Hell, why not just **cut out every intermediate step** and make it so easy that all you have to do is click a button, and you can import or export a layout to or from your website?
* So that’s what we did.

And it was everything we hoped it could be, and more. It validated the feeling we always had that there was something that just wasn't quite right about the old way.

In fact, everything that was wrong with the old way was now painfully obvious, because we had made something that was **so much better**.

It didn’t take long for us to realize this wasn’t just better for us, it was **better for everyone**. We saw pretty much right away that this was how everybody should be storing, importing, and exporting their layouts.

So we made it available to everyone. And that’s how WP Layouts was born.

**But wait…there’s more!** (Sorry, I couldn’t resist :))

Our layouts are some of our most popular products. And there’s a good reason for that. I say this a lot, and I genuinely mean it: I would put our team of developers and designers up **against any team in the world**.

Using the layouts that our team creates, you can make websites that will absolutely knock people’s socks off.

So we’ve included a whole bunch of them for **free**!

This is great if you’re a developer or designer who is just starting to branch out into making websites for a living, because it will immediately give you a fantastic library of layouts to build off of. And as you create your own dynamite layouts, you can save those in your WP Layouts library as well. So you’ll always have super convenient, one-click access to all of your favorite layouts, whether you made them yourself or got them from somewhere else.

It’s also great if you’re a developer or designer with a little more professional experience under your belt, and you could use a few fresh new designs in your arsenal.

In fact, we believe anybody creating websites should have these layouts at their disposal. We think you’ll end up coming back to them **over and over again**.

So when you take everything together:

* The enhanced stability (**no more crashes!**)
* The super-streamlined **one-click import / export** process
* The intuitive, **easy to navigate library** with **thumbnails** and **search functionality**
* The free collection of **amazing layouts**, with easy access to a treasure trove of some of **the best layouts** on the web

…we truly believe that we’ve created the **ultimate plugin for importing/exporting, storing, and managing your layouts**. Use it for two weeks (heck, even **one day**), and you won’t even be able to imagine going back to the “old way.” **I guarantee it.**

Start using WP Layouts today!

One of the things that makes WordPress special is the community of developers, designers, WordPress business owners, and everyone else who uses the platform, whether it’s for business, hobby, or other personal use.
And one of our guiding principles is that we want to contribute to this community in ways that helps everyone do what they do, and do it better. And that’s equally true for WP Layouts. We’re **extremely** confident that you’re going to absolutely love WP Layouts.
